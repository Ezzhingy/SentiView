The waiter got my order wrong,
I had to wait for over and hour for my food,
The wait was one of the longest I have ever seen,
Pat is the rudest waiter I have ever met,
The restaurant was unclean,
I had an excellent dinner,
The dinner was delicious, I can not recommend this place enough,
I enjoyed Bob's entr√©e recommendations,
The restaurant was beautiful inside,
The restaurant provided a beautiful view of the city,
The food was served in a good portion,
I ordered a pizza,
The food was mediocre
